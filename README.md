# mobileye-project
A multi-phased project, where the end goal is to find traffic lights as well as the distance to them.

## Phase 1
  Detect all possible light sources 
  
## Phase 2
  Filter the light sources using a neural network trained on images and some augmentations to increase the amount of data
  
## Phase 3
  Find distances to given traffic lights 
  
## Phase 4
  Integrating all phases, to build a working system
